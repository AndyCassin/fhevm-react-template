# Confidential Patent License Platform

> A privacy-preserving patent licensing marketplace powered by Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

## 🔐 Overview

The Confidential Patent License Platform revolutionizes intellectual property licensing by enabling secure, private transactions on the blockchain. Using advanced FHE technology, patent holders can license their innovations while keeping sensitive business terms completely confidential.

## 🌟 Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

FHE enables computation on encrypted data without decryption, ensuring complete privacy throughout the entire licensing process. Key benefits include:

- **Private Royalty Rates**: Negotiate licensing fees without revealing exact percentages
- **Confidential Revenue Reporting**: Submit revenue data while maintaining business privacy
- **Encrypted Bidding**: Competitive bidding without exposing bid amounts to competitors
- **Secure Terms**: All licensing terms remain encrypted on-chain

### Privacy-Preserving Patent Marketplace

Our platform creates a confidential marketplace where:

1. **Patent Registration**: Register patents with encrypted licensing terms
2. **License Requests**: Request licenses with private fee proposals
3. **Confidential Auctions**: Participate in sealed-bid auctions for exclusive licenses
4. **Royalty Management**: Pay and verify royalties while keeping revenue data private
5. **Territory Control**: Manage geographic licensing rights with encrypted territory codes

## 🎯 Key Features

### For Patent Holders

- **Confidential Registration**: Register patents with encrypted minimum fees and royalty rates
- **Private Bidding System**: Launch confidential auctions for exclusive licensing rights
- **Automated Royalty Tracking**: Monitor payments with encrypted revenue verification
- **Flexible Licensing Terms**: Set exclusivity periods, territory restrictions, and auto-renewal options

### For Licensees

- **Private Proposals**: Submit license requests without exposing business strategies
- **Sealed-Bid Auctions**: Compete for exclusive licenses with confidential bids
- **Confidential Reporting**: Report revenue and pay royalties privately
- **Multi-Territory Support**: Request licenses for specific geographic regions

### Advanced Capabilities

- **Encrypted Revenue Caps**: Set maximum revenue thresholds privately
- **Confidential Verification**: Verify royalty payments using FHE computations
- **Status Management**: Active, suspended, or expired patent tracking
- **Auto-Renewal Options**: Automated license renewals with encrypted terms

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Features

The platform utilizes FHE-enabled smart contracts on the Sepolia testnet:

- **Contract Address**: `0x6Cabd68b533F593D268344cB1281E50699001E0E`
- **Network**: Sepolia Testnet
- **FHE Library**: Zama's fhevm SDK
- **Encryption Types**: euint64, euint32, euint8 for different data types

### Encrypted Data Types

```solidity
euint64: Royalty rates, license fees, revenue amounts
euint32: Exclusivity periods, revenue caps
euint8: Territory masks and permission flags
```
